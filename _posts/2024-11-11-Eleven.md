# Today

Today, is the day that it is.

I wonder why the tutorial wanted the bit after title in quotes, this time.

Also noticed that this editor doesn't like three-space tabs. I'm, as far as I know, the sole pioneer for 3-space tabulation. When I was first introduced to programming, tabs were still used instead of spaces (which still seems reasonable, to me, from a semantic position), and they were 8-space tabs. Way too much. Especially when things started getting heavily nested. So, being the kind of guy that I was (a progenitor to the guy that I am), I started reducing the amount until it felt "right". I was getting somewhere with 4-space tabs, but it didn't feel "there" yet. It was Papa Bear. Three -- three felt *just right* -- Baby Bear. But, having a scientific bent, I went further. Two-space tabs were Momma Bear. There are clearly a lot of people in this field that have Momma-issues. And Papa-issues. Issues, period. But so many Momma boys. Either Freud was onto something, or he was a great perverter of many generations. That was an aside. Of course, I went further. One-space tabs were a hilarious joke. A joke worth revisiting, but not a place worth building a family.

So, yeah, 4 is too many, 2 is too few -- 3 is just right. But I'm the only one that's discovered this, it seems.
